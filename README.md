*cuesplit* is a simple tool for reading cuesheet files, splitting CDD-images
and filling tracks' metadata, it is free and anybody may use its code in
accordance with GNU GPLv3.

*cuesplit* is written in Debian bullseye environment, I use python3.8.3
for debugging this tool. *cuesplit* depends on:

* python3-chardet;
* shntool;
* flac.

These dependencies must be installed.

Right now, *cuesplit* is not ready yet.
